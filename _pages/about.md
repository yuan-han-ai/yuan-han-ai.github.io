Hi! I am Han Yuan, a Ph.D. student at Duke-NUS Medical School. I received double B.S. degrees in Biology and Applied Mathematics (ranking: 1st/80) from Nankai University. During my undergraduate education, I participated in several different research projects, including adverse drug reaction analysis, childrenâ€™s medical abnormal development analysis, ambulances' layout and dispatch, and genomic adaptation of species members in fig wasp community. Subsequently, I worked as a research scholar at Harvard University, concentrating on missing data in case-contro study and K-M estimator of progression-free survival. Apart from academic experiences, I also completed business analytics internships at Bank of China and Founder Securities.

My current research interests focus on Interpretable Machine Learning and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) in Healthcare. I have published 2 (co-) first author papers and 5 co-author papers in high-ranked journals and conferences, including Journal of Biomedical Informatics and Journal of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research.
