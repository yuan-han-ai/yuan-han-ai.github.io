Hi! I am Han, a Ph.D. student at [Duke-NUS Medical School](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/). I received double B.S. degrees in Biology and Applied Mathematics (ranking: 1st/79) from [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/), where I participated in several projects like adverse drug reaction analysis, childrenâ€™s medical abnormal development analysis, ambulances' layout and dispatch, genomic adaptation of species members in fig wasp community, etc. Subsequently, I worked as a research scholar at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) and [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en.html), concentrating on research fields of epidemiology and medical informatics, respectively. My industry experiences include two business analytics internships at [Bank of China](https://www.boc.cn/en/) and [Founder Securities](https://www.foundersc.com/).

My current research interests focus on [Interpretable Machine Learning and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) in Healthcare](publications). I am widely interested in understanding the logic behind "black box" ML models and how to automate the whole process of ML from data collection to model deployment.

I am always happy to try different milk tea brands and flavors. Whether looking for a research collaborator or milk tea partner, do not hesitate to email me at yuan.han@u.duke.nus.edu
