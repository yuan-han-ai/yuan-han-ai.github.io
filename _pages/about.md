Hi! I am Han Yuan (袁涵), a Ph.D. student at Duke-NUS Medical School. I received double B.S. degrees in Biology and Applied Mathematics (ranking: 1st/80) from Nankai University. During my undergraduate education, I participated in several different research projects, including adverse drug reaction analysis, children’s medical abnormal development analysis, ambulances' layout and dispatch, and genomic adaptation of species members in fig wasp community. Subsequently, I worked as a research scholar at Harvard University, concentrating on missing data in case-contro study and K-M estimator of progression-free survival. Apart from academic experiences, I also completed business analytics internships at Bank of China and Founder Securities.

My current research interests focus on Interpretable Machine Learning and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) in Healthcare. I am widely interested in understanding the logic behind "black box" ML models and how to automate the whole process of ML from data collection to model deployment.

I am always happy to try bubble tea of different brands. Whether looking for a research collaborator or bubble tea partner, do not hesitate to email me at yuan.han@u.duke.nus.edu
